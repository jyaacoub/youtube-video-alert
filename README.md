I created this to learn more about using Google APIs with my Raspberry PI as an interface. It basically sends alerts to when a specific channel uploads their video.

The code for the PI functionality is pretty much the exact same as with my COVID scraper (https://github.com/jyaacoub/COVID_Kingston_Scraper)

Will add more to this readme later.
